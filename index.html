    <h3 class="text-center">Renaissance</h3>
    <p class="text-center">Renaissance was a cultural movement that spanned roughly from the 14th century to the 17th century. This was one of the richest period in European art. The Renaissance was a fervent period of European cultural, artistic,
      political and economic “rebirth” following the Middle Ages. Generally described as taking place from the 14th century to the 17th century, the Renaissance promoted the rediscovery of classical philosophy, literature and art. Some of the
      greatest thinkers, authors, statesmen, scientists and artists in history of mankind including Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo Buonarroti, thrived during this era, while global exploration opened up new lands and cultures to European
      commerce. The Renaissance is credited with bridging the gap between the Middle Ages and modern-day civilization.

          <p class="card-text">Year:1486</p>
          <p>The ‘Birth of Venus’ depicts the classical myth of Venus rising from the sea. In the painting the goddess of love, Venus, born out of a seashell, a fully mature woman, is arriving at the sea shore. Scholars have proposed many
            interpretations
            of the painting with the most prominent one being that Botticelli represented the Neoplatonic idea of divine love in the form of a nude Venus. Botticelli’s ‘Birth of Venus’ remains one of the most treasured artworks of the Renaissance.

          <p>The work done by Michelangelo on the Sistine Chapel ceiling is a cornerstone of Renaissance art and ‘The Creation of Adam’ is the most famous fresco panel of the masterpiece. The popularity of the painting is second only to ‘Mona Lisa’;
            and along with ‘The Last Supper’, it is the most replicated religious painting of all time. The image of the near-touching hands of God and Adam has become iconic of humanity and has been imitated and parodied innumerable times.</p>

          <p>Many critics consider Giotto as the first genius of modern painting and some claim that no artist has surpassed him with only a handful coming close. His fresco cycle on the Scrovegni Chapel is one of the most important masterpieces of
            Western art and ‘The Kiss of Judas’ is the most famous painting of the cycle. The painting captures the moment of betrayal when Judas identifies Jesus to the soldiers by kissing him. Giotto masterfully captures the drama and confusion
            of the arrest of Christ as well as the contrast of expressions of Jesus and Judas as they look face to face.</p>

          <p>In ‘The Last Supper’, Leonardo masterfully depicts the bewilderment and confusion that occurs among the disciples of Jesus when he announces that one of them would betray him. Leonardo’s detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and
            geology; his interest in how humans register emotion in expression and gesture; and his subtle gradation of tone; all come together to make this painting among the most revered and famous works of all time.

          <p>Raphael’s masterpiece, ‘The School of Athens’, is one of the four main frescoes on the walls of the Stanze di Raffaello, in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. The four paintings epitomize Philosophy, Poetry, Theology, and Law; with
            ‘The
            School of Athens’ representing Philosophy. Critics have suggested that every great Greek philosopher can be found among the 21 painted in the painting. However, apart from Plato and Aristotle, who are placed in the center of the scene,
            no one’s identity can be verified with certainty. ‘The School of Athens’ is considered “the perfect embodiment of the classical spirit of the High Renaissance.”</p>

            but left the composition entirely to Michelangelo. Michelangelo was working on a first version of this statue in his shop in Macello dei Corvi around 1515, but abandoned it in roughed-out condition when he discovered a black vein

            represents the Biblical hero David, a favoured subject in the art of Florence. Originally commissioned as one of a series of statues of prophets to be positioned along the roofline of the east end of Florence Cathedral, the statue
            was placed instead in a public square, outside the Palazzo della Signoria, the seat of civic government in Florence, where it was unveiled on 8 September 1504. Because of the nature of the hero it represented, the statue soon came

          <p>‘Assumption of the Virgin’, located on the high altar in the Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, was the first commission of Titian in Venice and it established Titian as lead painter of the city. The painting depicts the
            ‘assumption
            of the virgin’, which is celebrated every year on August 15 and commemorates the rising of Mary to heaven before the decay of her body. In the painting, Virgin Mary is raised to the heavens by a swarm of cherubim while standing on
            a cloud. ‘Assumption of the Virgin’ is considered as the greatest masterpiece of Titian, one of the most versatile and popular painters in history.

          <p>The ‘Mona Lisa’ has been acclaimed as “the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about and the most parodied work of art in the world”. Its fame rests, in particular, on the elusive smile on the woman’s face
            which is why it is also known as “la Gioconda”, or the laughing one. For Da Vinci, the ‘Mona Lisa’ was forever a work in progress, as it was his attempt at perfection. The painting was never delivered to its commissioner; Da Vinci
            kept it with him till the end of his life. Guinness World Records lists the ‘Mona Lisa’ as having the highest insurance value for a painting in history. It was assessed at US$100 million on December 14, 1962, which after adjusting
            inflation, would be around US$759 million today.

          <p>‘Sistine Madonna’ depicts the Madonna, holding the Christ Child and flanked by Saint Sixtus and Saint Barbara. Also there are two winged cherubs beneath Mary, who are perhaps the most famous cherubs depicted in any picture. Such is there

            among the world’s paintings’ and accorded the epithet ‘divine'”.</p>

          <p>The ‘Birth of Venus’ depicts the classical myth of Venus rising from the sea. In the painting the goddess
            of love, Venus, born out of a seashell, a fully mature woman, is arriving at the sea shore. Scholars have
            proposed many interpretations of the painting with the most prominent one being that Botticelli represented
            the Neoplatonic idea of divine love in the form of a nude Venus. Botticelli’s ‘Birth of Venus’ remains one
            of the most treasured artworks of the Renaissance.

            Many critics consider Giotto as the first genius of modern painting and some claim that no artist has
            surpassed him with only a handful coming close. His fresco cycle on the Scrovegni Chapel is one of the most
            important masterpieces of Western art and ‘The Kiss of Judas’ is the most famous painting of the cycle. The
            painting captures the moment of betrayal when Judas identifies Jesus to the soldiers by kissing him. Giotto
            masterfully captures the drama and confusion of the arrest of Christ as well as the contrast of expressions
            of Jesus and Judas as they look face to face.

            The Last Judgement is one of the most influential works in fresco in the history of Western art. Painted on
            the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City, it depicts the Second Coming of Christ (a future
            return of Jesus to earth) and the final and eternal judgment by God of all humanity. Jesus is shown in the
            center of the painting and is surrounded by prominent saints; while the Resurrection of the Dead and the
            Descent of the Damned into Hell is shown in the zone below.

            In ‘The Last Supper’, Leonardo masterfully depicts the bewilderment and confusion that occurs among the
            disciples of Jesus when he announces that one of them would betray him. Leonardo’s detailed knowledge of
            anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in how humans register emotion in expression and gesture;
            and his subtle gradation of tone; all come together to make this painting among the most revered and famous
            works of all time.

            Raphael’s masterpiece, ‘The School of Athens’, is one of the four main frescoes on the walls of the Stanze
            di Raffaello, in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. The four paintings epitomize Philosophy, Poetry,
            Theology, and Law; with ‘The School of Athens’ representing Philosophy. Critics have suggested that every
            great Greek philosopher can be found among the 21 painted in the painting. However, apart from Plato and
            Aristotle, who are placed in the center of the scene, no one’s identity can be verified with certainty. ‘The
            School of Athens’ is considered “the perfect embodiment of the classical spirit of the High Renaissance.”

            is in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome, to the left of the main altar. The work was
            commissioned in June 1514, by the Roman patrician Metello Vari, who stipulated only that the nude standing
            figure would have the Cross in his arms, but left the composition entirely to Michelangelo. Michelangelo was
            working on a first version of this statue in his shop in Macello dei Corvi around 1515, but abandoned it in
            roughed-out condition when he discovered a black vein in the. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristo_della_Minerva">Read more</a>

            David is a masterpiece of Renaissance sculpture created between 1501 and 1504, by Italian sculptor, painter,
            architect, poet Michelangelo. It is a 4.34-metre, 5.17-metre with the base marble statue of a standing male
            nude. The statue represents the Biblical hero David, a favoured subject in the art of Florence. Originally
            commissioned as one of a series of statues of prophets to be positioned along the roofline of the east end
            of Florence Cathedral, the statue was placed instead in a public square, outside the Palazzo della Signoria,
            the seat of civic government in Florence, where it was unveiled on 8 September 1504. Because of the nature

            legs, slightly bent and separated, are covered by a band of fabric. His right arm is raised to hold his bent head, while his left hand remains unfinished, but seems to hold the band of fabric...more on

    <h3 class="text-center">Baroque</h3>
    <p class="text-center">Baroque art emerged in Rome, the artistic capital of Europe in the 17th century and spread to other European countries where it merged with local traditions and cultures.
      Baroque means irregularly-shaped pearl, derived from barocco in Portuguese, first used during the mid-1700s.
      Baroque art does not have any relation to pearls but the word was used as an epithet for a style that did not meet the great artistic standards of the preceding Renaissance era. Regardless of its origin, it carried connotations of “bizarre” and
      “absurd” when used by its critics who dismissed it as a decadent successor to the revered Renaissance movement. Till the end of the 19th century and occasionally in the present time, some people use this word in its original sense as an insult
      towards anything they find grotesque or abnormal.
      The Baroque Style also resulted in some majestic landmarks in modern Europe architecture...<a href="https://www.identifythisart.com/art-movements-styles/pre-modern-art/baroque-art-movement/" target="_blank">read more</a>

          <p>Antonio Canova’s statue The Three Graces is a Neoclassical sculpture, in marble, of the mythological three charites, daughters of Zeus – identified on some engravings of the statue as, from left to right, Euphrosyne, Aglaea
            and Thalia - who were said to represent beauty, charm and joy. The Graces presided over banquets and gatherings primarily to entertain and delight the guests of the gods. As such they have always proved to be attractive
            figures for historical artists including Sandro Botticelli and Bertel Thorvaldsen. A version of the sculpture is to be found in the Hermitage Museum); another is owned jointly and exhibited in turn by the Victoria and Albert
            Museum and the National Galleri.

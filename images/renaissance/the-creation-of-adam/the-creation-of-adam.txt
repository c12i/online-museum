Artist: Michelangelo Buonarroti

Year: 1512

The work done by Michelangelo on the Sistine Chapel ceiling is a cornerstone of Renaissance art and ‘The Creation of Adam’ is the most famous fresco panel of the masterpiece. The popularity of the painting is second only to ‘Mona Lisa’; and along with ‘The Last Supper’, it is the most replicated religious painting of all time. The image of the near-touching hands of God and Adam has become iconic of humanity and has been imitated and parodied innumerable times.
